The array methods made it really easy to handle the list. I used push() to add new items and pop() to remove the last one without writing long code. The filter() method helped me search for specific items quickly by checking which ones matched the user’s search term. These methods made the code simpler and easier to understand.

At first, it was a little tricky to make the search case-insensitive and handle empty inputs. I had to use toLowerCase() and trim() to make sure the search worked correctly even if the user typed extra spaces or used uppercase letters. Testing different cases helped me fix those small issues.

I would add a feature to delete specific items instead of just removing the last one. Also, saving the list in localStorage would be helpful so the data doesn’t disappear after refreshing the page. Adding some styling and letting users press Enter to add items would make it more user-friendly too.
